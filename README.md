# Password Generator

## Description
This is the third assignment, the task was to use a website which already had HTML and CSS implemented but to make it functional (create a javascript function).
Using JavaScript the developers extrapolates data through a series of prompts asking for the password criteria.
After all the data had been gathered through a series of prompts, the Javascript function would generate a password tailoring to all the data gathered and displaying it on the screen.
